v0.2.1

* Fix a nasty bug where option 'to' in convert(to: 'foo') could get clobbered

v0.2.0

* No more aliased keywords (with, apply) only set, append, prepend
* No more aliases: build, execute; only run
* All strings are now escaped, so make sure you split arguments to `set`
* Keyword `write` renamed to text (consistent with ImageMagick)
* Keyword `save` is renamed to `write` (consistent with ImageMagick)
* No more piping support (no point, use composition instead)
* Blocks are now evaluated upon declaration (still without running the command)
* It's now ok to assign convert to a variable that's also used inside the block
* No more Image class, image method now aliased to convert
* Sugar is implemented in a much more straightforward way
* Code amount is significantly reduced

v0.1.1

* Add Skeptick.timeout (seconds) for limiting runtime of convert operations
* Add ability to pass spawn options to `run` (e.g. override default timeout)

v0.1.0

* Initial release
